# Chisel-Addon
Simplified fork of MC77Rivers' Chisel addon, a port of the Minecraft Java Chisel Mod to Bedrock Edition.

Thank you to @MCRivers77 for the original addon, which has been modified to meet our uses.


### Blocks

The pack has been trimmed down to use the following blocks: 
- andesite, 
- basalt, 
- bricks, 
- cobblestone, 
- concrete (all types),
- deepslate 
- diorite, 
- end stone, 
- granite, 
- honeycomb, 
- limestone (new block), 
- marble (new block), 
- nether brick,
- packed ice, 
- paper (new block), 
- planks (all wood types), 
- prismarine, 
- purpur, 
- quartz, 
- red nether brick, 
- stone.

Variants of the above are crafted by putting the base block, or respective variant, into the stonecutter.

New blocks:
- Limestone: Crafted with 1 stone, 1 bonemeal. Nets 2.
- Marble: Crafted with 1 stone, 1 diorite. Nets 2.
- Paper: Crafted with 4 sticks in the corners, 4 paper in the remaining perimeter, and nothing in the center. Nets 8.

Also added chisel to the top of the crafting table texture.
